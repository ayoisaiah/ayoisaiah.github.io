Earlier this week, I completed the last of the [intermediate algorithm challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseIntermediateAlgorithmScripting) which leaves me with just the Advanced Front-End Projects for the first level certification.

While most of the algorithms were pretty straightforward, one or two of them proved tough to crack and I had to revise my code multiple times before finally getting a working solution that passed all the tests.

In the end, it was a fairly decent exercise and I've certainly gained some new knowledge and I know exactly where I need to put in more work.

If you're interested in looking at my solutions, they can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/algorithms/intermediate).

## What's next

As previously mentioned, I'm moving on to the [Advanced Front-End Development Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseAdvancedFrontEndDevelopmentProjects) this weekend. Thankfully, before Free Code Camp restructured the curriculum, I had already completed the [JavaScript Calculator](http://codepen.io/ayoisaiah/full/NxMEpe) and [Pomodoro Clock](http://codepen.io/ayoisaiah/full/wMZYvg) projects which means I'll be moving straight to the Tic Tac Toe Project and I hope to have it ready within the next week.

Aside from the standard user stories, here are a few things I'd like to implement in this project:

- Make the Computer AI really smart
- Two Player Mode
- Add a win counter

Additionally, I'll be working through the [Advanced Algorithm Challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map#nested-collapseAdvancedAlgorithmScripting) simultaneously. I found out that completing this section is not necessarily required for certification so I felt I should spend the majority of my time working on the projects instead.

Nonetheless, I'm aiming to complete this section of the curriculum before the end of next week.

## In Other News...

I'm taking a programming course this semester at my University in which we'll be learning Java. So I've just signed up for [Udemy's free Java Course](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/learn/v4/overview) which seems to be highly regarded so I'll be working though that in the coming weeks.

I do not see myself deviating from the web development path anytime soon but I figured there's no harm in exploring other languages and learning a thing or two from them.
